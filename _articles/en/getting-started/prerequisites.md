## Prerequisites

Before you get started, install the required software on your computer.

## Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit

Some features in Salesforce Scanner depend on the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK). Install either version 8 or higher version of the JDK.

## Salesforce CLI

Use the Salesforce CLI to execute commands against Salesforce orgs and work with source files on your local computer. Salesforce Scanner uses Salesforce CLI behind the scenes, so even if you donâ€™t want to use the CLI directly you must install it on your machine.

For information about installing Salesforce CLI, see the _[Salesforce DX Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)_.
