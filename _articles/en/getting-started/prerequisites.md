## Prerequisites

Before you get started, install the required software on your computer.


## Salesforce CLI

Use the Salesforce CLI to execute commands against Salesforce orgs and work with source files on your local computer. ISVTE Plugin uses Salesforce CLI behind the scenes, so even if you donâ€™t want to use the CLI directly you must install it on your machine.

For information about installing Salesforce CLI, see the _[Salesforce DX Setup Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)_.
