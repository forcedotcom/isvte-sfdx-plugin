  	With a shift in our priorities, we regret to announce that the ISVTE Plugin will no longer receive active maintenance and updates. Consequently, we will be archiving the repository to concentrate our efforts on enhancing our existing suite of products and crafting innovative tools tailored for our valued ISV partners. We extend our heartfelt appreciation for the unwavering support you've shown us throughout this journey.

## Salesforce ISV Technical Enablement Plugin (ISVTE Plugin)

### Description

As the Salesforce ecosystem continues to rapidly expand, it can be very difficult for an app developer to stay on top of everything they need to know. You cannot always know when best practices evolve or when features emerge, let alone where to find the information. 

This is where the ISV Technical Enablement Plugin for SalesforceDX (ISVTE Plugin) comes in. The ISVTE Plugin is designed to give enablement specific to the application you're building by looking at which technologies you are using surfacing only relevant information. It does this always with the ISV point of view in mind. Think of it as an automated Technical Evangelist available on demand.

The ISVTE Plugin provides several types of information to help you:
- **Metadata Inventory** what metadata is being packaged?
- **Recommended Enablement** guides and resources to help you take full advantage of the technolgy 
- **Feature Recommendations** learn about relevant new platform features and how they can help
- **Quality Notes** best practices to improve your app and your customers' experiences
- **Partner Alerts** known issues or upcoming changes that impact you
- **Installation Warnings** which Salesforce editions will support your app
- **Dependencies** cloud, namespace, and feature dependencies
- **Exclusive or Offensive Language checks**  identify text within your app that might not be appropriate
- **Partner Program Technology Adoption Survey** identify technologies that contribute to the technology adoption score to help determine your ISV Partner Program tier

### Quick Start

It is very simple to start getting insight out of the plugin. If you're already using SalesforceDX, you can [get going in less than a minute](./en/getting-started/install).

Once you have the ISVTE Plugin installed, you simply execute it against your package metadata and start benefitting.
